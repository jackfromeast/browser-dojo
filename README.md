## What is the Web-Pwn?

The term 'Pwn' typically denotes binary exploitation through memory corruption vulnerabilities in CTF. While, 'Web' focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the modern web world, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection, which primarily are injection-based vulnerabilities. 'Web-Pwn' is a specialized term that describes the exploitation of memory-related vulnerabilities within essential web components like browsers, JavaScript runtimes, PHP runtimes, and others. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by an attacker through specific web-based operations.

This repository is used to collect a list of ctf challenges of 'Web-Pwn' with the exploit code and writeups.

*TODO: hope we can find another way of classification instead of the challenges. For the how2heap, they use heap exploitation techniques.*
